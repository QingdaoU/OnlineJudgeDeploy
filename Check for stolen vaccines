<p class="article-title">Protect yourself and your credit cards from Internet Scams</p>

<p class="article-author">by Conrad LeBeau</p>

<p>The Internet is a vast reservoir of information, unprecedented in the history of mankind. There are three groups of people who use the Internet. The first group are honest, sharing, good, selfless and usually non-profit. One example of a selfless site is Wikipedia, a non-profit org. They provide a virtual encyclopedia of free information on a wide range of topics. Wikipedia is supported by small donations and accepts no advertising. While I find the writings at Wikipedia are 90 to 99% in agreement with my own research on a range of topics, I have also found some misleading articles that I blame on "experts" who use the good reputation of Wikipedia to spread misinformation.</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">An example being an article at Wikipedia on vaccines that supports the view that all vaccines are safe. There are legitimate concerns about the safety of some vaccines, but the pro vaxxers are so adamant that science supports them, that they have closed their minds, and they are angry at doctors who publish research that challenges the safety of vaccines. However, on the subject of money, Wikipedia states that they have found no law in existence today that defines what a "dollar" is, and on that point, I certainly agree with them. ref: my book on "<a href="http://lebeaubooks.com">Money Creation</a>"</p>

<p>The second group is the largest, and they seek to monetize sales by using search engines to keep track of what people are interested in and present them with an endless array of pop-up ads. The most common search engine to do this is Google. Google makes billions of dollars targeting audiences with advertising of products and services based on Internet search engine results.</p>

<p>Purchases made at ebay, paypal and amazon.com are protected with refund policies or money back guarantees. If in doubt about any product or the company that distributes it, always check with the Better Business Bureau where the manufactuer is located.

<p>The third group of Internet users are downright evil. Some are even part of the dark web where stolen credit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers, and birth dates are bought and sold. This group is criminal, self serving, deceptive and manipulative. Also, readers who have a few bucks to invest are often victims of get rich quick schemes especially in the investment newsletter category. One reason why people are tricked into making big purchases, automatic renewals and longterm contracts is that they either don't read or understand the "Terms and Conditions" of the sale. The other problem is "short term money back guarantees" - an example being such as 30 days or less from the date of purchase.</p>

<p>Consider that if you make an investment to buy a book or an investment newsletter and you are told you have a money back guarantee but you don't read the fine print in the "Terms and Conditions" of the purchase that is limited to 30 days.</p>

<h4>What is wrong with a 30 day money back Guarantee?</h4>

<p>What is wrong is that when you make an Internet purchase with a debit or credit card, your monthly statement usually takes about one month (30 days) to arrive. If you are not satisfied with the book, newsletter or product you purchased and you seek to cancel the purchase and get your money back, guess what? By the time you make this decision, your 30 days is up. You probably did not read the terms and conditions of the sale. Second, it takes about 30 days just to get your bank statement.Then you have to remember which credit card you used while your guarantee is already expired.</p>

<h4>Why you should never use a debit card or your bank account to make a purchase on the Internet</h4>

<p>The problem with using a debit card is that a thief or dishonest marketer who gets your debit card number can steal thousands of dollars out of your checking or savings account with illegal purchases before you catch them. Then, who will help you recover your money once it is stolen? Call the police? The police will probably tell you to call the FBI or to see a lawyer. Do you really need to make your life so complicated and difficult? I know of people who have lost not just hundreds but thousands of dollars by using a debit card or by using their bank account number on the Internet.</p>

<h4>Why a credit card or paypal are the only monetary instruments you should use on the Internet.</h4>

<p>For most credit card companies, if you question an unauthorized purchase and offer a plausible explanation that fraud was involved in the use of your credit card, they will remove the charges from your account. Make sure you return the product to the sender with delivery confirmation and require a signature as proof of delivery, or, if you did not receive the product at all, the company must offer proof of delivery.</p>

<h4>Your safest choice - a prepaid credit card for Internet purchases</h4>

<p>If you want to be really safe, pay a hundred dollars, more or less, for a prepaid credit card from your local drug store or check cashing place. In the event someone scams you, you limit the damage to the amount you placed on the prepaid credit card. Your checking or savings account that could have a substantial amount of money in it is not affected. It is better to be safe than sorry.</p>

<h4>Two more bits of Advice - Never link your savings account to your checking account to cover overdrafts</h4>

<p>The reason is obvious. If someone steals your checking account, they can keep writing checks and making purchases as long as money flows from your savings into your checking to cover the overdrafts, and if that someone is on the other side of the earth, what are you going to do about it? So never link your accounts together. While banks make billions of dollars each year with overdraft fees, thieves steal billions of dollars more with stolen credit cards, debit cards and bank account numbers.</p>

<p>Also, if your have several thousand dollars on deposit, you might want to keep your checking account in one bank and the savings account in a second bank, and, of course, DO NOT ask for overdraft protection linking the two.</p>

<h4>Newsletter Investment Teasers and Scams - always check with the BBB (Better Business Bureau before buying)</h4>

<p>Recently, one publishing group called Stansberry research came to my attention after I received an email ad from them where they made one unsubstantiated claim after another. A Google search on the Internet with the terms "stansberry research" and "Better Business Bureau" yielded several results. The search found links to the hometown of Stansberry research that stated: This business is not BBB accredited." Another article claimed that there were over 70 complaints filed with the BBB in Baltimore MD about Stansberry Research. One article about the founder, Porter Stansberry, reported on his legal problems with the SEC. The article raises several questions about his marketing practices. As the time worn phrase "Caveat Emptor" indicates - Let the Buyer Beware.</p>
