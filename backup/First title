{"{\"title\":\"First Title\"}"=>nil, "format"=>:json, 
"controller"=>"api/v1/products", "action"=>"create", "user_id"=>"2"}
Whereas, they need to come through like this:

  {"title"=>"First Title", "format"=>:json, 
  "controller"=>"api/v1/products", "action"=>"create", "user_id"=>"2"}
Currently, on the iOS side, I am sending through the params like so:

let params = ["title": "First Title"]
How can I send the params from the iOS side so that they come through to the rails side in the correct format?

Just for a little more info, this is the response I'm getting in my Terminal when I do the post request:
