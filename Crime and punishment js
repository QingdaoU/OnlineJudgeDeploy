am fairly new to node.js and i am wondering how to (or even if) i can read and write to a JSON file. I am trying to create an accessible punishment history. Ideally i would want to be able to create something along the lines of this:

{
"punishments": {
    "users": {
      "<example user who has a punishment history>": {
        "punishment-1567346": {
          "punishment-id": "1567346",
          "punishment-type": "mute",
          "punishment-reason": "<reason>"
        },
        "punishment-1567347": {
          "punishment-id": "1567347",
          "punishment-type": "ban",
          "punishment-reason": "<reason>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Then i would have a way to access the formatted punishment history. I genuinely have no clue where to start.
